# SeaTable OpenAPI

Welcome to the SeaTable OpenAPI Definition Repository! üåäüîç‚ú®

This repository encompasses all supported API calls for the SeaTable Server. The OpenAPI definition here serves two primary purposes:

1. Generate the online API reference accessible at https://api.seatable.io.
2. Generate the Postman collection, which is available at https://www.postman.com/seatable.

The repository is organized into version branches.

## Tests

This repository contains automated tests to detect possible regressions. The tests use [Schemathesis](https://schemathesis.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
to extract information from the OpenAPI files and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.2.x/) to run the actual tests.

### Prerequisites
